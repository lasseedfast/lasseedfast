- 👋 Hi, I’m @lasseedfast, a journalist and documentary producer in Sweden.
- 👀 I’m interested in data journalism as a part of my daily work, both as part of research and for workflows in Devonthink, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, although Python is still my first choice in most situations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on international data journalism where I can contribute with research on individuals and text and data analysis.
